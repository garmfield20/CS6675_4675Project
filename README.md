Covid 19 Distribution and Vaccination System

Sign-up as one of these three options at the /user/signup page
- Patient
- Physician
- Distributor

Patients have the ability to signup, provide important personal information, and login into our patient portal.
In here, the patient can view his/her profile, view upcoming appointments, or sign up for a new appointment.
Patients will have access to a list of appointments determined by location, vaccine type, dose, and time.

Physicians have the ability to signup and select their place of work from the distributor tab linking their
profile to that of the company's distributor profile. When logged in, the physician is able to view their profile,
current appointments they will facilitate, and add additional appointments to their schedule.

Distributors have the ability to register their location as a site for COVID-19 vaccines. After signing up, they can
log in and log their vaccines as they are recieved, assign particular vaccines to appointments, and create appointment
windows for both physicians and patients to utilize. Additionally, the distributor can see the registered physicians
under their profile page and assign specific physicians to any appointment allowing flexibility of use. Distributors 
can finally view a list of the appointments they created to keep a log of general progress.
